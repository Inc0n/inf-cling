* inf-cling
This is a new package provides basic interaction with a Cling subprocess (REPL).

Therefore you need to install https://github.com/root-project/cling.

The predecessor https://github.com/brianqq/inferior-cling is 10 years old, and there is input echoing which is dealt with in this package (https://github.com/root-project/cling/issues/481)

To start, enable =inf-cling-minor-mode= in a c++ buffer (using mode hook for example), and =run-cling= (or ~C-c C-z~). Now you can start evaluating regions (~C-c C-r~)or buffers (~C-c C-b~).
